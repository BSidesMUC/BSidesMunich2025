- bio: "**Javier Vazquez Vidal** is a **hardware security specialist** with a lifelong
    passion for electronics and embedded systems security, who has been delivering
    hands-on hardware security trainings for over a decade. He released his first
    public research project at Black Hat Arsenal USA 2013 and DEFCON with the ECU
    tool, followed by the CAN Hacking Tool (CHT) at Black Hat Asia 2014 and his research
    that demonstrated that it was possible to compromise the Spanish smart power grid
    at Black Hat Europe. \r\n\r\nIf you see him around and want to talk with him or
    ask him some questions, make sure to bring an extra **beer** or **coffee** along,
    depending on the time of the day."

title: Introduction to Hardware Fault Injection
track: 5
---

# Don't miss the glitch!

In the past few years, many new **open source tools** have arisen that enable reliable fault injection attacks at a reasonable budget.
In addition to this, many great performing budget tools are now available that are perfectly suitable for a broad range of fault injection targets.
This brings a great opportunity to get started with **hardware security** and learn about hardware fault injection attacks while experimenting.
The part that is a bit more challenging is that most of these tools assume that you are an expert in the field and therefore they are limited to providing an interface with many options and features, some heavily tested examples and target boards that work with these examples and that are specifically designed to give the feeling of success, while not truly diving into the process and decision-making that led to them.


This workshop is intended to fill in that gap and introduce you to the basic steps that need to be taken in order to prepare and profile a generic target and be able to start a Voltage Fault Injection (**VFI**) or Electromagnetic Fault Injection (**EMFI**) campaign, all while using budget-friendly equipment and inexpensive open source hardware tools.
