title: 'Cloud-Native Chaos: Hacking CI/CD and Cloud Environments'
track: 5

CI/CD pipelines significantly increase development efficiency but also introduce complex security risks.
Vulnerabilities in these systems expose sensitive credentials, enable attackers to manipulate build processes, compromise cloud environments, and escalate privileges.
This immersive, hands-on workshop will guide participants through real-world scenarios and hacking challenges to exploit and secure CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes clusters, and AWS infrastructure.
