Eduardo was born in Guatemala and has been part of the organizing team for the past few years, after starting out as a volunteer. Based in Munich, he works on keeping complex systems secure and running smoothly. Outside of that, he enjoys bouldering, snowboarding, and most recently, the wild adventure of being a new dad.
