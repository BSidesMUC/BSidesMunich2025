This talk explores why the NIS-2 Directive is not gaining traction in German SMEs, even though many of them are now in scope. Based on a bachelor thesis, the presentation talks about a self-developed NIS-2 Self-assessment tool, mappings to common standards (ISO 27001, TISAX, IT-Grundschutz), and outreach to 1800 SMEs across Germany.

The talk includes insights from 17 interviews with CEOs, CISOs, and IT managers, covering how companies perceive the regulation, why many have not started implementing, and what they expect from lawmakers. It also highlights the impact of Germany's delayed transposition into national law. Attendees will leave with a grounded view of the current state of NIS-2 implementation in the German Mittelstand and ideas how to bridge the ap between regulation and reality.
