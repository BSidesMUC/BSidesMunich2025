title: 'Structuring (cyber) incident root-cause investigations: a practical walk-through'
track: 1

Product Security teams (aka PSIRTs) face a common challenge: how to structure an incident root-cause investigation that ensures alignment with stakeholders' or regulatory requirements? 

This 25‑minute session (plus 5 min Q&A) provides a practical example on how to structure a product incident response process, scope outputs, choose tools based on forensic and threat‑driven requirements, and encode repeatable investigation workflows using the opensource framework DFIQ.


Real examples show how high‑level investigative questions map to forensic artifacts and techniques.
Based on the recent work of a team redesigning their investigation process and toolset, this talk delivers practical value to anyone building or refining incident-response and digital-forensics workflows.
