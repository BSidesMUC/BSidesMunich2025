title: 'Unmasking the Unseen: Effortless Linux Malware Reversing with LLMs'
track: 1
---

While the threat of Linux malware grows, its complexity is often overestimated.
Many samples lack sophisticated obfuscation, making them prime targets for modern analysis.
This talk introduces a cutting-edge methodology that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into the reverse engineering workflow.
We will demonstrate how to leverage LLMs with a disassembler to automate the analysis of Linux binaries, generating detailed functional reports in minutes.
Attendees will gain practical techniques to harness AI for faster, more efficient threat hunting, empowering them to unmask the inner workings of Linux malware with unprecedented speed.
