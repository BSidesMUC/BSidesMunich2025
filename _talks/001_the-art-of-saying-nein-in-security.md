title: The art of saying NEIN (in security)
track: 1
---

Have you ever advocated for better security measures, requested more budget for security, asked a security-team to takeover additional responsibilities, ...
and received a "NEIN"? 
Or even had to say "NEIN" yourself? 
In this NEINth edition of BSIDES Munich Martin will shed some light on the many facets of saying "no" in security and how it has affected him.
More importantly, he will share personal findings from his past 20 years in security on how to eventually turn "no" into "yes".
