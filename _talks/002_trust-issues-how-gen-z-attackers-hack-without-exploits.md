title: 'Trust Issues: How Gen Z Attackers Hack Without Exploits'
track: 2
---

Forget zero-days - today’s attackers are skipping the code and going straight for your trust.
In this talk, we’ll explore how a new wave of cybercriminals, many young, non-technical, and highly creative, are bypassing traditional defenses using native tools, built-in features, and social engineering.
From abusing RMM software and Microsoft Teams messages to weaponizing OneNote, these attackers don’t need exploits; they need credibility.
We’ll break down real-world tactics, show how these attacks unfold, and discuss why defenders must shift their mindset from patching vulnerabilities to patching human trust.
