Social engineering attacks aren’t about breaking technology—they’re about breaking people.
This talk dives into the powerful intersection of cybersecurity and psychology, revealing how attackers exploit instinctive human behaviors to deceive, persuade, and manipulate.
Drawing from real-world examples and backed by scientific research, we’ll explore the psychological mechanisms behind successful social engineering attacks.
We’ll examine how these same psychological principles can be repurposed to build resilience, not just awareness.
You’ll learn why traditional security training often fails to change behavior and how to replace it with effective, science-backed techniques: psychological inoculation, decision friction, cultural reinforcement, and behaviorally designed systems.
