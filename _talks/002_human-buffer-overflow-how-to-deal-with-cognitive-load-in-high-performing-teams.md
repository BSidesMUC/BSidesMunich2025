title: 'Human Buffer Overflow: How to Deal with Cognitive Load in High-Performing
  Teams'
track: 2
---

High-performing teams thrive when focus, flow, and collaboration are supported – not interrupted.
But what happens when security requirements unintentionally overload a team’s cognitive capacity? In this talk, we’ll explore how excessive cognitive load – what I call a Human Buffer Overflow – can reduce a team’s ability to deliver high-quality, creative solutions.
Drawing from real-life examples, I’ll share practical strategies to reduce friction: from automating security tasks, to integrating security into agile workflows, to launching inclusive Security Champions programs that empower teams rather than burden them.
Let’s shift security left – without burning teams out.
