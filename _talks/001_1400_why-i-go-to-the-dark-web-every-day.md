title: Why I Go to the Dark Web Every Day
track: 1

The Dark Web is a scary place.
In order to deter the cybercrime, I feel confident exploring its dangerous grounds and know well how to use the Dark Web to defend the victims.
I want to invite you on this journey of venturing far beyond your defense perimeter, where cyber criminals are just planning their attacks, and teach you how you can use this knowledge as defensive skills to prevent attacks from happening in the first place.
