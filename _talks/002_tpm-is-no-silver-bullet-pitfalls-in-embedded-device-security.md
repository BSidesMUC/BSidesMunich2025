title: 'TPM Is No Silver Bullet: Pitfalls in Embedded Device Security'
track: 2
---

With the growing adoption of TPMs (Trusted Platform Modules) in the Linux ecosystem, thanks to features like TPM-backed disk encryption in systemd and the longstanding use in Windows BitLocker, TPM chips are seeing a resurgence as a go-to for secure secret storage.
This trend is increasingly making its way into embedded devices.
Often as a measure to fulfill NIS2, EU Cyber Resilience Act or similar requirements.

However, embedded systems present a vastly different threat model compared to desktops or servers, and TPMs often donâ€™t deliver the level of security many developers assume.
In this talk, David will demystify TPM functionality in embedded Linux environments.
He will give a concise overview of security threats for embedded devices and where a TPM can and or where it cannot help.
Special focus will be put on using TPMs for disk encryption and integrity.

The session will wrap up with a discussion of alternative approaches, other usage scenarios for TPMs, and how to make informed decisions when designing secure embedded systems.
