    analysis, and internet infrastructure research. My focus is on the intersection
    of technology and civil liberties, particularly how network-layer protocols are
    used—and misused—by state actors to control access to information.

title: 'Turning Off the Internet: Technical Tactics of State-Scale Censorship and
  Shutdowns'
track: 2

Authoritarian regimes are increasingly leveraging the internet’s architecture to exert real-time control over communication and information.
This talk dissects the technical mechanisms used to surveil, filter, and shut down internet access at scale.
From deep packet inspection and TLS fingerprinting to BGP hijacking and protocol suppression, we examine how entire populations are digitally silenced.
Real-world measurements from global observatories such as OONI, IODA, and RIPE Atlas illustrate the anatomy of large-scale blackouts.
Attendees will gain a deep technical understanding of how modern censorship is implemented—and how it continues to evolve.
