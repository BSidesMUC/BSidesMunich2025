I am involved with the Networking Security Industry since 1994 and have been engaged in many big projects. I worked for more than 20 years at Cisco Systems digging deep into network security.
One of my tasks at Cisco Systems was to organise and lead the Security Track of CiscoLive! for more than 10 years. I am always happy to work with people and love to be involved with security related events.
Since 2023, I am working as a Senior Domain Consultant at Palo Alto Networks and specialised in OT Security. In my spare time, I love to spend time with my family, doing small theater plays (with hand puppetsâ€¦) for kids and enjoy good food and wine.
