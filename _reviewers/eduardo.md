Eduardo was born in Guatemala and has been part of the organizing team for the past few years, after first jumping in as a volunteer. Heâ€™s been working in cybersecurity since 2008, gradually shifting from hands-on technical work to leading global teams and shaping strategy. Now based in Munich, he enjoys bouldering, snowboarding, and figuring out the daily puzzle of being a new dad.
