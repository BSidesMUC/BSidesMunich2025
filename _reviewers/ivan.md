Fueled by curiosity and caffeine, Ivan has worked across vulnerability and incident management, security automation, and research. These days, he's exploring the finer points of product and program management, secure development practices, and making life easier (and safer) through automation. Outside of work, you'll likely find him tinkering with side projects, or attempting to finish that ever-growing stack of tech books and computer games.
